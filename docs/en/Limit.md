### 💡 How to Increase Your Printer Limit?

Need more than 2 printers? You can expand your limit using one of two support options:

#### Option 1: Support the Project ⭐
- Give a ⭐ **star** to the [zMod](https://github.com/ghzserg/zmod) repository on GitHub
- Take a screenshot as proof
- One star grants you **+1 additional printer**

#### Option 2: Voluntary Donation 💰
Cost: **500 RUB per additional printer per year**

Available payment methods:

| Method | Details | Important |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **🇷🇺 Russian Rubles** | [Payment link](https://pay.cloudtips.ru/p/3cbf9e9f) | Include your zmod.link **username** in the sender's name |
| **₿ Bitcoin** | `17wXTd9BqYp1K3zCLTxVyGLEXUDjf7XNLL` | Send the BTC equivalent of **500 RUB** per printer* |

> \* BTC amount varies with market rate. Calculate the equivalent of **500 RUB** using the current exchange rate at the time of transfer.  
> Example (approximate): at 1 BTC ≈ 4,200,000 RUB → 500 RUB ≈ **0.00012 BTC** per printer.

**Limit expansion examples:**

- 500 RUB / ~0.00012 BTC → +1 printer (total: 3 printers)
- 1,000 RUB / ~0.00024 BTC → +2 printers (total: 4 printers)
- 1,500 RUB / ~0.00036 BTC → +3 printers (total: 5 printers)
- etc.
